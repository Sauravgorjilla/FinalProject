# Final Project
Design:
The Object Oriented Program uses a combination of different classes and objects created in the program,
as well as normal functions in order to have the player play tic tac toe. First of all, the code opens up with the intro function,
that asks the 2 players to identify themselves, and picks one of the two players randomly to go first and be the X player or the O player.
It then defines a class called the “Player” class and a class called the “Board” to set up the board and the game.
The attributes of the Board class set up the game board on which the game is played, and determine which spaces go to which team.
The “Game” class sets the game into motion and determines who won the game of tic tac toe.
Next, the program defines a function called the play function,
that uses the classes previously set up in order to create a function that actually executes the game.
Finally, a loop is used in order to actually play the game, and see if the player wants to end the program or play again,
where it will just continue the loop again.
A portion of the code was borrowed from open forums and mended heavily to fit the program and our requirements,
hence the inclusion of some functions that may have not been included in our course.

Requirements:

Tic Tac Toe is played on a 3 by 3 grid
One player is assigned X, one player is assigned O
Player X goes first, Player O goes 2nd and the players alternate turns
If any player gets 3 Xs/Os in each direction they win
If the grid is filled up and there isn’t a winner, the game is declared a tie
